    "input images, meaning that the autoencoder learns to reconstruct the original inputs. By imposing various constraints on the \"code\", i.e. \n",
    "the output of the encoder, one can get the autoencoder to learn more or less interesting latent representations of the data. Most \n",
    "commonly, one would constraint the code to be very low-dimensional and sparse (i.e. mostly zeros), in which case the encoder acts as a way \n",

    "(`z-mean`) can be decoded to something similar to `input_img`, thus forcing the latent space to be continuously meaningful. Any two close \n",
    "points in the latent space will decode to highly similar images. Continuity, combined with the low dimensionality of the latent space, \n",
    "forces every direction in the latent space to encode a meaningful axis of variation of the data, making the latent space very structured \n",
    "and thus highly suitable to manipulation via concept vectors.\n",
